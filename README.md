📊 Dataset Overview
The model uses comprehensive project data with 500+ projects across India:

Feature	Description	Impact on Demand
Budget_Cr	Project budget in crores	High positive correlation
Tower_Type	Type-A to Type-D towers	Type-D requires 80% more materials
Substation_Type	132kV to 765kV substations	765kV requires 2x materials of 132kV
Geographic_Risk	Terrain difficulty (1-10)	High risk increases demand by 5-10%
State	Project location across India	Regional variations in requirements
Month	Project timeline	Seasonal construction patterns
🏗️ Model Architecture
🔧 Feature Engineering
python
# Cyclical features for seasonal patterns
df['Month_Sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['Month'] / 12)
df['Month_Cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['Month'] / 12)

# Interaction features
df['Budget_Risk_Interaction'] = df['Budget_Cr'] * df['Geographic_Risk']
df['Risk_Adjusted_Budget'] = df['Budget_Cr'] * (1 + df['Geographic_Risk'] / 10)

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
bash
Python 3.8+
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Quick Start
python
# Load the trained model
import joblib
model_artifacts = joblib.load('powergrid_random_forest_model.pkl')
rf_model = model_artifacts['model']

# Make instant predictions
prediction = predict_material_demand(
    state='Rajasthan',
    tower_type='Type-C', 
    substation_type='400kV',
    budget=95.0,
    tax_rate=18,
    month=8,
    geo_risk=6
)
💡 Usage Examples
1. Quick Demand Prediction
python
quick_demand_prediction(
    state='Assam',
    tower_type='Type-D', 
    substation_type='765kV',
    budget=120.0,
    tax_rate=18, 
    month=3,
    geo_risk=8
)

# Output:
# ⚡ QUICK DEMAND PREDICTION:
#    State: Assam
#    Tower Type: Type-D  
#    Substation: 765kV
#    Budget: 120.0 Cr
#    Month: 3
#    Geographic Risk: 8/10
#    📦 PREDICTED MATERIAL DEMAND: 1680 tons
#    🛡️ Recommended procurement (with 10% safety): 1848 tons
2. Multi-Month Forecasting
python
# Get 6-month demand forecast
forecast_results = []
for month in range(7, 13):
    demand = predict_material_demand(project_details)
    forecast_results.append({'Month': month, 'Demand_Tons': demand})
